# J-CANSAT

J-CANSAT is an educational project that combines the concept of CanSat (a miniature satellite) with innovative technology. This repository contains the code and resources related to the J-CANSAT project.

## Description

The goal of the J-CANSAT project is to provide students and enthusiasts with a hands-on experience in the development and operation of a CanSat. A CanSat is a soda can-sized device that integrates various components such as PCB boards, sensors, communication modules, and data storage. It enables simulated satellite missions, collecting and transmitting real-time data.

This repository includes the necessary source code for programming and controlling the CanSat, as well as design files for 3D printing the CanSat casing. In addition, it provides technical documentation, user manuals, and other useful resources to help users understand and effectively utilize the CanSat.

## Features

- Source code for CanSat programming
- Design files for 3D printing the CanSat casing
- Technical documentation and user manuals
- Additional resources such as libraries and configuration files

## Requirements

- Compatible hardware platform (specify required platform)
- Programming and configuration software (specify required software)
